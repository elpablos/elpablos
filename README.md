# Pavel Lorenz — StaffEng @ Heureka Group

Pragmatic Architecture

I help teams ship **good-enough architectures** that run safely and evolve sanely. 
Company-wide scope @Heureka: 

- **strategy** (platform guardrails, high-level architecture) and 
- **tactics** (short unblockings, patterns, clean hand-off)

Prefer **boring, reliable tech** over shiny complexity. 

- **Pragmatism > perfection**
- **Impact > buzzwords**

Now
- Public & internal **APIs** (REST/gRPC), OAuth2/OIDC, versioning & SLAs
- **Distributed services** with clear contracts, observability, and cost awareness
- **DX** that makes the right path easy: standards, docs, CI/CD, guardrails
- Decision-making via RFC/ADR; **good-enough now, extensible tomorrow**

Principles
- **Simple > perfect** — ship → learn → iterate
- **Enable, don’t own** — align, unblock, hand back delivery
- **Own the interface** — contracts, SLAs, idempotence
- **Prefer boring** — reliability beats shiny
- **Measure** — p95, error rate, availability, infra cost
